                    <p>In September 2001, at the invitation of Liu Gang, the general manager of "Shanghai Painters'
                        Village", the Hebei Oil Painters' Gallery moved to Shanghai and settled in Room 2003 of the
                        Painters' Village. The works of the Hebei Oil Painters' Gallery were displayed in the exhibition
                        room at the entrance of the Painters' Village exhibition hall, which was particularly
                        eye-catching. The works of Ming Jing were specifically requested by Liu Gang and were soon
                        purchased and collected by friends from Singapore. In November of the same year, it participated
                        in the "Shanghai Art Fair" and the "Gallery Invitation Exhibition of Shanghai Art Fair", and has
                        participated for three consecutive years. Many works have been collected at home and abroad.</p>
