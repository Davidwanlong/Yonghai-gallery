        <h5>Our Story</h5>
        <p>
          This website is built for Wang Yonghai, my wife’s father and his circle of artist friends in Hebei province of
          China. I have been fortunate enough to know them and some of them I am quite familiar with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Wang was born on February 7, 1951. he has been both an artist and an art collector since 1970s. He is an
          art teacher by profession. But outside of work he is an artist and collector. The latter reached the point of
          obsession, so he ended his teaching career early and devoted himself to art. For decades, while painting, he
          collected all kinds of art, especially ancient painting art. He painted himself and bought works by artists he
          liked. Over the years, the house has been filled with all kinds of art. The impression of the home is more
          like an art warehouse. It has always been Mr. Wang's wish to one day live off the sale of his collection. But
          since entrepreneur is not compatible for his artist’s character, this scope has never been prosperous . About
          20 years ago, Mr. Wang set up a small gallery in Shijiazhuang and later moved it to Pudong in Shanghai, but
          overall, the profits were not great.

          In January 2024, I entered SAIT to study. I majored in graphic design in the first academic year and web
          design and development in the second academic year. Designing a website was initially a learning task, but I
          thought it would be better to make something really useful, so I started designing a website to display and
          sell artists' paintings online. This will be a surprise to Mr. Wang.
        </p>
        <p>
          As my skills improve, so will the website. This is going to be a long-term thing, no matter how the business
          goes. If the future goes well enough for me to settle down in Calgary, I hope to find a suitable location in
          downtown Calgary and set up a small gallery.
        </p>
        <h5>Times and Inspiration</h5>
        <p>
          When I started planning my website, I thought of Nietzsche’s words: Madness is rare in individuals - but in
          groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule. I don't know how much progress have we made in our time.
          Russia-Ukraine war, Sino-US disagreement. In the face of the tide of the Times, ordinary individuals are
          insignificant and ensnared in it. How many people's hopes for a peaceful life have been torn apart?

          A few days ago I was passing through the Bowness Valley, and in the bushes by the side of the road I spotted
          an unknown wildflower in full bloom. I was amazed at how lonely and beautiful it was. Compared with the
          complexity of human affairs, I think this flower is the symbol of my website. I wanted my site to reflect the
          lives of artists, peaceful and otherworldly, just like that flower. In this sense, they are eternal.
